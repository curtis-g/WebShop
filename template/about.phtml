<h1>About this website</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I began this assignment by first doing some research into other food webstores to get an overall idea of what I wanted my website to operate and look like, after I decided on the feel of the website I then went on to write the HTML and CSS for the index page. I began by writing the code for the header, where I’ve included the disclaimer in an easily noticeable red box. I also included the navigation bar on the header as I feel it makes the website look a lot more professional being there rather than on the side. I then did some research into PHP and SQL databases using websites on the internet and helpful YouTube videos so that I could write the code, I found Annie’s provided examples very helpful with implementing the session into the website. I decided to split the PHP and HTML into separate files as it keeps the code looking a lot cleaner, and I found it a lot easier to deal with any errors. I implemented the shop page by storing the returns from the database query into an array using a while loop for each row. To store items in the basket I used select boxes and then stored the selected items in the session variable. I implemented an option for the user to both remove selected items and to clear the basket completely. To test the website I had another person use my website and see if they could encounter and obvious errors, I then added some JavaScript validation to fix these errors, although I feel a lot more validation could have been added with more time.</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Overall I feel like the website runs well and creates the impression of a real webstore. All of the requirements of the specification have been reached expect for the filter, I attempted to implement a filter to the shop page and managed to get the filter working correctly and filtering results based on ‘greater than’ or ‘less than a value’ a value the user is allowed to enter into a text box but when trying to save the products to the basket it was throwing an error, I feel like I could of remedied this given enough time, but I had to make sure that the rest of the requirements were met and I felt like a working basket page was more important than a filter. I am happy with the HTML and the CSS as there is only a single (needed) error with the HTML. The error is using the ‘name’ attribute in forms, because name is not a recognised attribute in XHTML but changing the attribute to id breaks the functions linked to that form, so in my eyes the error is needed. Other than the error the HTML and CSS all work perfectly. Overall I am very happy with my website as I feel it looks and runs very well, but given more time I feel a lot could be improved on the webstore. </p>
